Over the past few years, there has been an increased interest in automatic facial behavior analysis and understanding. We present OpenFace – an open source tool intended for computer vision and machine learning researchers, affective computing community and people interested in building interactive applications based on facial behavior analysis. OpenFace is the ﬁrst open source tool capable of facial landmark detection, head pose estimation, facial action unit recognition, and eye-gaze estimation. The computer vision algorithms which represent the core of OpenFace demonstrate state-of-the-art results in all of the above mentioned tasks. Furthermore, our tool is capable of real-time performance and is able to run from a simple webcam without any specialist hardware.

The code was written mainly by Tadas Baltrusaitis during his time at the Language Technologies Institute at the Carnegie Mellon University; Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge; and Institute for Creative Technologies, University of Southern California.

Special thanks goes to Louis-Philippe Morency and his MultiComp Lab at Institute for Creative Technologies for help in writing and testing the code, and Erroll Wood for the gaze estimation work.

# Final remarks

I did my best to make sure that the code runs out of the box but there are always issues and I would be grateful for your understanding that this is research code and not a commercial level product. However, if you encounter any problems/bugs/issues please contact me on github or by emailing me at Tadas.Baltrusaitis@cl.cam.ac.uk for any bug reports/questions/suggestions.
